Personal Computer Shopping Hub and Marketplace at the Rig Platform

## About the Project

Introducing “the Rig”, a pioneering e-commerce platform dedicated to simplify purchasing personal computers and their components in Bangladesh. We understand the complexities users encounter when navigating the market for personal computers and components. Specially in a developing country like Bangladesh, where providing better deals to the users without any hidden condition is still not a common practice. Hence, our solution offers a unique approach, simplifying price comparisons and minimizing the financial and physical challenges associated with building custom PCs.
At “the Rig”, users gain access to a comprehensive platform where they can effortlessly compare prices from various online and offline stores, eliminating the need for multiple tabs and exhaustive searches. Whether users seek individual components or pre-built PCs, we provide diverse options to suit every preference and budget.


## Problem Statement

The Bangladeshi PC market is plagued by syndicates run by the big names. As a result, existing platforms lack transparency in pricing and product information, resulting in a fragmented and confusing shopping experience for consumers. Keeping all the hassles in mind a consumer has to take to simply build a PC, here is a pressing need for a user-centric e-commerce platform like "the Rig" to disrupt the market by promoting transparency, accessibility, and security while simplifying the PC shopping process for all users, regardless of their technical expertise.
